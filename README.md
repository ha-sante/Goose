# Still in development
I started this project because the alternatives were not that easy to use for me, stemming from the many paradigms each library offered. Hence my rebuild of a simpler version that's easier to understand and use, based on simpler principles. I have been quiet busy these days hence my delays in updating this simple library am working on. 
I have scheduled time for it in the months to come before the ending of this year. Hopefully v1 of this library will be ready for you and I to use.

I have also taken notice of my increasing unuse of MongoDB in my workflows. I started this to sharpen my skills and also work on something solid. 
I would expect users to work on this library when it is ready.
I also have some plans in mind for what this could be and will throw it in here as well soon.


(In general I like to get there even before am there, hence my plenty talks)


# Goose
An elegant ODM for the Go language, inspired by Mongoose.js -(Basically an Object Document Mapper makes operating on a database a little bit more easier)

# Features
- A collection of results features              ( .Save() | .UpdateById | .DeleteById() )
- A collection of results search features       ( .FindOne() | FindById() | .Find() )
- A collection of results manipulating features ( .Skip(), | .Limit() )


# Using Goose
- Use goose to connect to your database
- Use goose to register your data models
- Use goose to perform operations on your data models along with the intended data
